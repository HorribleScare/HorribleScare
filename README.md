### Hey there! 👋

I'm David, a **full-stack web developer** based in Indonesia. 🚀

I mostly work on 💻 **backend stuff — PHP, MySQL/phpMyAdmin, ASP.NET** 💻, and occasionally touch 🎨 **frontend stuff — HTML, CSS, JavaScript**. 🎨

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll **build it, test it, and ship it**. ✨

This is a fresh profile where I **build projects from scratch**, **experiment with new tech**, and **share my learning journey** — feel free to **explore** or **reach out**! 📫
